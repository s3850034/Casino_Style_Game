Game Rules

-- When you run the program you will see an application open with the House pre selected.
-- The House cannot press buttons such as Bet,Deal,Remove Player or Clear Bet.
-- You will proceed to add a player who will ask you for the player id, player name and player balance 
   (the program will tell you what sort of info you are supposed to give)
-- Upon adding a player, this player's current info will be shown on the summary panel, 
   he/she will be automatically selected by the combo box and you can now press the buttons
-- As soon as one player deals, the program forcefully stops the addition of new players or the removal of any players. The other players present 
   however can still place bets or clear bets.
-- Upon dealing for all the players and house, you can then go the the menubar and click on Play Again now, 
   this is the only time you can press this menu item.
-- The game program itself will make the rules more clearer.
